## 🚀 The All-in-One Kaspa Solution

Kaspa Gateway solves ecosystem fragmentation. Instead of juggling a CLI node, a separate bridge, and web explorers, Gateway combines all essential tools into one secure, intuitive desktop application.

---

## ✨ Features

* **Full Node & Bridge Control:** Run a full `kaspad` node and manage your `ks_bridge` for solo mining directly from a simple UI.
* **Advanced Analytics & Explorer:** Track network health, explore the "Rich List," and manage your addresses, all powered by a high-performance `duckdb` backend.
* **Security-First Design:** Protects your keys using the OS `keyring` and sanitizes all logs and inputs to prevent leaks or injection attacks.
* **Modern & Accessible:** A multi-language, professional UI with data export (PDF, CSV) and automatic crash recovery.

---
